# DJMAX Clear Pass Auto-Farmer

## What is this?

This is just a "glorified" hotkey for F5 and Enter buttons that will alternate between a second.
Just press F1 to start or stop the automation. xd

## How to use?

1. Run this app.
2. Create a private mutiplayer lobby with password so that no one will enter and interrupt your automation.
3. Set your key mode to OBSERVE
4. Select your preferred song. Recommended is **Put Em Up** as it is the shortest song in the game.
5. Press F1 to Start the F5 and Enter automation.
6. Go do something else while it does the magic. Unfortunately, you cannot do anything else on your PC.
7. Press F1 again to Stop the F5 and Enter automation.
8. Close this app if you don't need it for the session. eksdee
